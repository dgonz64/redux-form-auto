#### Bugs

If you find a bug, open an issue. There will be probably needed code samples or, better, a project that reproduces the bug. In any case, provide as much information as you can about the expectations vs reality.

#### Coding

Follow the style of the file you are editing or choose freely if creating a new file.

If there are involved design ideas, it would be greatly appreciated to be known before the corresponding code.

## Thank you very much!
