redux-form-auto needs your help. Skins must be written!

Where to begin
--------------

Make a fork and do your magic followed by a `pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`_.

Some code pointers
------------------

Everything is work in progress until there's a bunch of skins or we are in complete control of the world, whichever comes first.

The most important files:

* ``schema.js`` where the class is defined
* ``ui/components/componentRender.jsx`` processes the schema to build the inputs and allows skin overrides

Style
-----

I just need you to follow the style of the file you are changing. If you create a file from scratch you can style it however you want provided it's not an obfuscated code contestant.
